description: The project deals with cancer related cause-effect relationships. Moreover, it aims to create a web-based assistance system for the exploration of cause-effect relationships of selected cancer types in a predefined geographic region. The work is a result of an external semester contribution, which was mainly focused on the modelling part (domain ontology, information aggregation).The current state is that cancer cause-effect information is available on the web as open data but in most instances nonaggregated and partially cumbersome to access. So, data collection can be the most time-consuming and expensive stage of epidemiological research. In this context, semantic technologies aid to the linkage of shared resources in a way that makes meanings explicit and automatic associations possible.<br><br>Purpose</br> The purpose of the system is to communicate spatial interdisciplinary information to the user like the distribution of emission sources of carcinogens or what kind of prevailing substances are at the same time carcinogens and cause primarily a certain cancer type, but not to make decisive analysis possible. The application presents possible causes for high cancer incidence rates in a spatial context. It does so, by using the chain linking of different variables that is encoded as linked data.<br><a href="https://github.com/lodum/CancerExplorer"><i class='fa fa-github-square'></i> Project on Github </a></br>
