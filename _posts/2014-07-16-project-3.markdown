description: A very nice project from a sympathic lithuanian company. It combines open environmental data with real estate information. Because I had also a similiar idea for a project (deals with real estate offers and environmental information like noise level, leisure activities etc.)  <a href="https://github.com/SIIGroupMHSRY/SIIproject"><i class='fa fa-github-square'></i> Project on Github </a> I was really stoked about the PlaceIlive.com project.So, I contacted the CEO and after a nice skype discussion i made a small contribution for their homepage. <br>Visit <a href="http://placeilive.com/">placeilive.com</a>
